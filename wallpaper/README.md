Various scripts that set dynamically changing desktop wallpapers. These should work on most GNOME/GTK+ based desktop environments that support the [GSettings](https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/GSettings.html) tool. Examples: [Budgie](https://solus-project.com/budgie/), [Cinnamon](http://developer.linuxmint.com/projects.html), [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/), [MATE](https://mate-desktop.org/), [Unity](http://unity.ubuntu.com/), [Yunit](https://yunit.io/). 

It would probably be easy to port these scripts to use something like `feh` or `xsetbg` for window managers like i3, bspwm, openbox, etc. A big hint would be to `grep` for *gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background ...* and replace it with your wallpaper setter of choice.



| Script              | Screenshot |
| ------------------- | --- |
| **color-wallpaper** <br> Sets the desktop to a random color. Amusingly, the simplest way I found to do this is by using `openssl`. Not many wallpaper setters can boast they generate colors securely!

| **fortune-wallpaper** <br> Sets the wallpaper to a random quote generated by the ubiquitous `fortune-mod`. Only short quotes are use for space reasons. <br><br> *MIT License* | [ ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithieopia/bin/master/.readme-assets/wallpaper-fortune1-thumb.jpg) ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithieopia/bin/master/.readme-assets/wallpaper-fortune1.jpg) [ ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithieopia/bin/master/.readme-assets/wallpaper-fortune2-thumb.jpg) ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithieopia/bin/master/.readme-assets/wallpaper-fortune2.jpg) |
| **natgeo-wallpaper** <br> Downloads and sets the wallpaper to National Geographic's [Photo of the Day](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photo-of-the-day/). The aspect ratio for the photos is unsuitable for HD monitors, so the script stretches and blurs a copy in the background to prevent ugly system colored bars typical with scaled wallpapers. <br><br> <br><br> *MIT License* <br> *Photos used in the screenshot are copyrighted by National Geographic* | [ ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithieopia/bin/master/.readme-assets/wallpaper-natgeo1-thumb.jpg) ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithieopia/bin/master/.readme-assets/wallpaper-natgeo1.jpg) [ ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithieopia/bin/master/.readme-assets/wallpaper-natgeo2-thumb.jpg) ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithieopia/bin/master/.readme-assets/wallpaper-natgeo2.jpg) |
| **sunlight-wallpaper** <br> A overlay that shows which parts of the world currently lit by sunlight and the daily clouds as seen from various satellites in orbit. I do none of the hard work and this is all thanks to die.net's [World Sunlight Map](https://www.die.net/earth/) and Xplanet's [Real Time Cloud Map](http://xplanet.sourceforge.net/clouds.php). <br><br> *Public Domain* | [ ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithieopia/bin/master/.readme-assets/wallpaper-sunlight-thumb.jpg) ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithieopia/bin/master/.readme-assets/wallpaper-sunlight.jpg) |
| **weather-wallpaper** <br> Current doppler weather radar for the contiguous U.S. The screenshot is deceptive as the wallpaper is actually animated; in a way you would expect from a weather radar. There is a brief pause between frames of the animation so that the live wallpaper isn't too distracting. <br><br> *MIT License* | [ ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithieopia/bin/master/.readme-assets/wallpaper-weather-thumb.jpg) ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithieopia/bin/master/.readme-assets/wallpaper-weather.jpg) |



## Enabling on Startup for GNOME / KDE
Create a [Desktop Entry](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html) file in *~/.config/autostart/* (you may need to create the folder) or */etc/xdg/autostart* if you want it to start for all users.

`~/.config/autostart/wallpaper.desktop`

```desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Wallpaper
Comment=Sets the desktop wallpaper
Exec=bash -c '$HOME/bin/wallpaper/natgeo-wallpaper'
Terminal=false
Type=Application
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
```

**NOTE**: Change the *Exec=* to the path of the wallpaper script you want to use
