# dotfiles: desktop

Per-user configs, found in my $HOME; most people know these as 
dotfiles. These are specifically for my desktop machine, so mostly GUI 
apps. See [everywhere](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/blob/master/everywhere/README.md)
for console things like bash and nano.

You may want to visit the main repo [README.md](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/blob/master/README.md) 
first, if you came here directly from somewhere else.

* [geany](http://www.geany.org/): a lightweight IDE, that can do most of
  what [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is known for. Sets
  up [base16](https://chriskempson.github.io/base16/) eighties dark 
  color scheme, among other things.
* [mpv](https://mpv.io/): a media player on par with VLC's extensive 
  support. Sets up hardware acceleration and hotkeys; *am I the only one 
  who thinks mpv's defaults keys are annoying?*
* [xdg-user-dirs](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs/):
  prevents annoying fluff directories (like ~/Desktop) from being 
  created in $HOME
* [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/): download flash videos
  from almost any site. Config disables IPv6 and anything greater than 
  720p, because my connection is bad. Coincidentally, you should avoid 
  any ISP who's name rhymes with "Calm Gas"
