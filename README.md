These are various config files I use for my Linux environment and related
programs.

**Obligatory Warning:** You should first fork this repository, review the code,
and remove things you donâ€™t want or need. Don't blindly use my settings unless
you know what that entails. Here be dragons!

## Directory

* [bash](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/tree/master/bash):
  .bashrc, aliases, functions, and .bash_profile to start Xorg without a login
  manager.
* [bspwm](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/blob/master/bspwm/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc):
  window rules and programs to autostart. Includes [hotkeys](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/blob/master/bspwm/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc),
  since [sxhkd hotkeys](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd) is basically part
  of bspwm.
* [compton](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/blob/master/compton/.config/compton.conf):
  shadow and opacity eye candy.

  for more info.
* [flash](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/blob/master/flash/.asoundrc):
  Adobe Flash only supports ALSA (not PulseAudio). Even at that it's too
  stupid to detect the correct sound card, resulting in no sound. This is the fix.
* [git](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/blob/master/git/.gitconfig):
  enable color, set the default GPG key, and allow pushing to non-bare repos.
* [mpv](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/tree/master/mpv/.config/mpv):

  mpv's defaults keys are annoying?*
* [nano](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/blob/master/nano/.nanorc):

* [remind](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/tree/master/remind):

  a easy to use console calendar, alarm, and reminder program
* [rxvt](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/tree/master/rxvt/.config/rxvt):
  cleans up the GUI, sets font and color scheme, and enables clicking on URLs.
* [ssh](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/blob/master/ssh/.ssh/config):
  use compression, keep alive, add keys to the agent, and some personal server
  aliases.
* [wget](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/blob/master/wget/.wgetrc):
  saner defaults so you're not waiting forever for failed downloads. Also, spoof
  the user agent
* [xorg](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/tree/master/xorg):
  Set the xcursor theme, font fixes (anti-aliasing, hinting, etc), and load
  urxvt settings (see [rxvt](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/tree/master/rxvt/.config/rxvt)
  section)
* [youtube-dl](https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles/tree/master/youtube-dl/.config/youtube-dl/config):

## Installation / Managing
These dotfiles are managed with [stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/),
which allows you to group dotfiles based on the programs they configure. Thus,
you can pick and choose which dotfiles you want to install.  

For instance, to install all the related bash dotfiles:

```console
$ cd ~  
$ git clone https://github.com/keithieopia/dotfiles.git  
$ cd dotfiles  
$ stow bash
```

Installing any of the system config files in "sys/" with stow is slightly
different, since you need them in / and not $HOME. To install "ssh":

```console
$ cd dotfiles/sys/  
$ sudo stow -t / ssh
```
