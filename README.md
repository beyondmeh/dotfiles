*Useful shell scripts in my $PATH*


## Synopsis
These are various shell scripts I use on a regular basis. You may find some of 
them useful

### Shell scripts:
 
* `battmon` - Will warn about battery levels with increasing severity and then 
   safely shut the system down if the battery gets too low.
* `clean` - Erases files, directories, browser cache, junk files, history files, 
   and slack space
* `cryptofox` - Create and launch an encrypted Firefox profile
* `disco` - Randomly colored lights in the terminal. For a more wholesome 
   experience, [play this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_sY2rjxq6M) 
   simultaneously. *Not mine; it was released into the public domain*
* `encrypt` - Wrapper for GPG symmetric encryption using AES256
* `homecache` - Create folders and files expected to be in ~/.cache normally, 
   useful if mounted as tmpfs
* `lemonlaunch` - Start a [lemonbar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar) panel with 
   useful system info, similar to conky
* `nullcrypt` - Creates and opens encrypted containers
* `optimize-images` Optimize images for the web by reduces image size and fixing 
   file names
* `playalert` - Plays a tune, called when a OSD notification is sent on my system
* `respawn` - Indefinitely restart a program after it exits
* `screenlock` - Locks the screen with a neat pixelated effect
* `volume` - Changes the speaker volume and sends an OSD notification


## Usage
All shell scripts include a help command that can be invoked by passing the `-h`
flag to them. This will print a brief explanation of what the script does as well 
as the usage and any flags or options that can be set.
