# Updating wallpaper of what Earth would look like from space, with live 
# clouds and sunlight. Since this is meant as wallpaper, we use a 
# Mercator projection instead of a globe.
#
# The image is created and distributed by die.net, this script only
# downloads and sets it as wallpaper. Most credit belongs to them:
