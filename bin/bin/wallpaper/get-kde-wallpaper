# Explaination:
#   qdbus [...]
#       dumps all of Plasma's current config as JavaScript
#       The relevant section looks like the following:
#       "/Wallpaper/org.kde.image/General": {
#                   "Image": "file:///path/to/your/wallpaper.jpg",
#
#   grep [...]
#       finds the Wallpaper section based on it's header and prints
#       the line after (see example above)
#
#   tail -1
#       removes the first line, leaving leaving just the line
#       with the wallpaper's path
#
#   sed [...]
#       extracts the path from the line

# CAVEAT #1:
#   KDE allows you to have different wallpapers on different
#   workspaces, but this script only shows first workspace's
#   wallpaper to prevent outputting duplicate lines.
#
#   Should you have different wallpapers for each of your workspaces,
#   Try removing the "-m 1" args from grep and "tail -1"
#
# CAVEAT #2:
#   If the path to the wallpaper is invalid, KDE is nice and instead
#   changes it to the built-in default wallpaper.
#
#   The path in the config is not updated in this case nor is it
#   marked as invalid. If you're using this in another script, you
#   should not trust it's output and check that the wallpaper file
#   exists.

# The following is a more terse example. On a fresh KDE install it will
# work as expected, but if the user has additional plasmoids installed
# it might fail as it searches by any image reported by qdbus
#
# qdbus org.kde.plasmashell /PlasmaShell dumpCurrentLayoutJS | sed -n 's:.*\"Image\"\: \"file\://\(.*\)"\,.*:\1:p' | head -1
