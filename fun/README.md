# ~/bin/fun

- `busy`: Look busy to those annoying people who shoulder surf
- `disco`: Randomly colored lights in the terminal. For a more wholesome experience, [play this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_sY2rjxq6M) simultaneously
- `quotes`: Random curated quotes in a easy to understand all-in-one format (compared to [fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_%28Unix%29))
- `rand-uncyclopedia`: random nonsensical snippets from [Uncyclopedia](http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page). A hilarious replacement for fortune or MOTDs.
